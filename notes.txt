encodeing password before request?
using django forms for login page >> look into just building own and how easy the django forms makes validation
Forms.py not ready

5/26:
-Having issues with login-required custom middleware: "if not match(..." logic is not cathcing when /account route hits. Still unsure about cause. If that is replaced with the @login_required decorator on relevent routes in views than everything works just fine.

6/7:
Look into model managers class for filtering functionality of properties/users (in model.py)

6/21: (Sasha)

- Created properties.css, properties.js
- Old properties.html is now called properties_old.html
- Current HTML being rendered from "properties/all" route is properties.html
- Created filter bar.
- Added to views.py new function to grab properties from DB.
- Added to urls.py new route to make request for properties.
