4/13:
encodeing password before request?
using django forms for login page >> look into just building own and how easy the django forms makes validation
Forms.py not ready


5/26:
-Having issues with login-required custom middleware: "if not match(..." logic is not cathcing when /account route hits. Still unsure about cause. If that is replaced with the @login_required decorator on relevent routes in views than everything works just fine.


6/7:
Look into model managers class for filtering functionality of properties/users (in model.py)
